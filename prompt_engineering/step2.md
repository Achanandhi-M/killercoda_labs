# Step 2 — Deploy Your Website to Netlify

Now that your website is ready, the final step is to **deploy it to Netlify** so it becomes a live website.

---

## Option A — If you have a GitHub repository
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com  
2. Click **“Add new site” → “Import from Git”**  
3. Select your GitHub repo  
4. If your project is a simple static website, you usually don’t need a build command  
5. Click **Deploy**  
6. Netlify will give you a public URL — save it

---

## Option B — If you downloaded a ZIP folder with HTML/CSS files
1. Go to Netlify → **Add new site**  
2. Choose **“Deploy manually”**  
3. Drag and drop your website folder (must contain `index.html`)  
4. Wait a few seconds  
5. Netlify will give you a public URL — save it

## Final Submission (what we expect)
Please prepare a short note that includes:

- The **AI tool** you used (Cursor / Lovable / Antigravity / Kiro)  
- The **final prompt** you used  
- The **live Netlify link** to your website  

That’s it — keep it simple and clean.

You have now completed the two-step prompt engineering lab!
