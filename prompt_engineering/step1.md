# Step 1 — Create a Website Using an AI Tool

In this first task, you will apply your prompt-engineering skills to build a small website using **any one** of the following AI tools:

- Cursor  
- Lovable  
- Antigravity  
- Kiro  

Choose whichever platform you are comfortable with.

## What you need to do

1. **Pick one AI tool** from the list above.  
2. Use clear and structured prompts to create a simple website.  
   - It can be a portfolio, a product page, a personal homepage, or anything you like.  
3. Your goal is to show how well you can guide an AI tool using good prompts.  
4. You can iterate multiple times until you are happy with the output.

## What to save for submission later
You will need this in Step 2:

- The **final website files** or the GitHub repo generated by the tool.  
- The **prompt** you used (copy and save it).  

Keep things simple. Don't overthink it — this task is about showing how you think and how you communicate with AI tools through prompts.

When you're ready, move to **Step 2**.
